name: cc-log-extract
description: Extract readable conversation turns from Claude Code JSONL session logs (the files under ~/.claude/projects/<project>/). Use when summarizing past sessions, writing a monthly/weekly activity report ("what did we build", "pull the chatlogs"), reviewing how a feature was implemented across a session, doing AI pair-programming ethnography, or tracking which model produced which turns. Strips tool-I/O noise and emits Markdown with model stamps.

# Extracting Claude Code session logs

Claude Code stores every session as a JSONL transcript under
`~/.claude/projects/<munged-project-path>/<session-uuid>.jsonl`
(the project dir name is the absolute cwd with `/` → `-`). Each line is one
record: `user` / `assistant` messages, plus harness records (`ai-title`,
`permission-mode`, `file-history-snapshot`, …). Assistant content is a list of
`text` / `thinking` / `tool_use` blocks; user content is a string or a list
that may include `tool_result` blocks. Raw, these files are mostly tool-I/O
noise — useless to read directly.

`cc-log-extract.py` distills them into readable Markdown: HUMAN + CC prose
turns, tool calls collapsed to one-liners (`[Edit: foo.py]`, `[Bash: pytest]`),
`thinking` and `tool_result` bodies dropped, consecutive duplicates merged, and
a **model stamp** per session (single-model → `Model: Opus 4.7`; multi-model →
per-turn-range breakdown + raw API strings).

## The tool — single source of truth

The script lives in the **substrate-independent** repo (it has its own test
suite there — `scripts/tests/test_cc_log_extract.py`); do not fork or copy it,
just call it where it lives:

```
~/Documents/koodit/substrate-independent/scripts/cc-log-extract.py
```

If that path is missing (repo not cloned on this machine), say so rather than
reimplementing.

```
python3 .../cc-log-extract.py SESSION.jsonl [MORE.jsonl ...] -o out.md [options]
```

Key options:
- `--tools summary` (default) one-liner per tool call · `edits` show Edit/Write
  content, omit Reads (light code-review mode) · `full` truncated tool input ·
  `none` prose only
- `--timestamps` — date+time on every turn
- `--per-turn` — tag each CC turn inline with its model (`*(opus-4-7)*`)

Multiple session files concatenate into one document — pass a whole project's
sessions at once.

## Recipe: monthly (or any date-range) activity report

1. **Find the sessions for the window.** mtime is a good first cut, but a
   session can span a month boundary — a late-April session resumed in May has
   a May mtime but April content, and vice versa. Filter by mtime, then
   sanity-check the boundary files by reading the first/last `timestamp` inside
   them. Subagent transcripts live under `<uuid>/subagents/agent-*.jsonl`;
   include or skip them deliberately.

   ```bash
   find ~/.claude/projects -name '*.jsonl' \
     -newermt '2026-05-01' ! -newermt '2026-06-01'
   ```

2. **Group by project** (the top-level dir under `projects/`) and run the
   extractor once per project, passing that project's sessions in chronological
   order, to `-o /tmp/<project>.md`. Use `--timestamps`; default `--tools
   summary` is right for "what was built" (the tool one-liners show the shape of
   the work without the noise). `ai-title` records give each session a
   human-readable title for free.

3. **Synthesize.** For a light month, read the digests directly. For a heavy one
   (a multi-MB project digest), fan out one subagent per project digest — each
   returns a structured "what was built" summary (deliverables, decisions,
   releases, per-session gist) — then write the report from those. This keeps
   the orchestrator's context clean.

## Other uses

- **"How did we build X?"** — extract the relevant session with `--tools edits`
  to see the actual diffs inline.
- **Ethnography / field notes** — `--no-tools` for pure HUMAN↔CC dialogue; the
  model stamps let you attribute behavior to a specific model version (the date
  suffix in raw strings is the *deployment* date, not the model identity).
