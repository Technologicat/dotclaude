# Deferred TODOs

## Add an internal-reference check to fleet CI

Fleet CI runs `ruff`, `cython-lint` and `pytest` — Python only. Nothing checks that
the *docs* still refer to things that exist. This session found several instances of
exactly that rot: a docstring in Raven giving a module path that no longer imports
(`raven.common.tests.lanczos_visual_test`, missing the `image` component), and, in
this repo before the cutover, cross-references to notes files that had been converted
into skills.

Wanted: a check that relative Markdown links resolve, and that file paths named in
docs and docstrings exist. Offline and deterministic — no network, so it can be
blocking without ever going red for reasons unrelated to the commit. That property is
the whole point; an external link checker on push would fail on rate limits and 403s
from CI runners, and a CI that cries wolf trains you to ignore it.

Design question to settle first: nine repos need this, and nine copies of a script
will drift. Options are a copy per repo (simple, drifts), a second SHA-pinned checkout
of this repo in each workflow (DRY, adds a cross-repo dependency), or a small reusable
composite action. Decide before rolling out.

Explicitly *not* in scope, having been considered and declined for now: external link
checking (worth doing eventually, but on a schedule rather than on push), and
`codespell`.

Note the limit of any of this. The failures that actually bit during the cutover —
CRT shader parameters a full edit behind reality, a benchmark run in the wrong venv, a
rationale that was fluent and wrong — are claims that drifted from the world, and no
linter checks a claim against reality. Machine checks buy the easy half.

Discovered during the `~/.claude` cloudification (2026-07-13).
